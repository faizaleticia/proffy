# Next Level Week

The Next Level Week is a proposal from Rocketseat with the objective of taking its participants to the next level. As its name suggests, it is an week-long initiative, where the development of a project takes place in practice, with a lot of code, challenges and connections with different people from around the world. Through this proposal, it is possible to get to know new tools, as well as, to know stacks that may come to boost the career of the participant in question. The Rocketseat made this event available for free and online in the first week of August 2020, where the Proffy project was developed.

## Days

# Proffy Project 

The Proffy project is an application developed with the aim of bringing students and teachers together. With that, teachers have the possibility to offer classes to everyone and students can search for these registered classes without leaving their homes.

This project, as promoted by Rocketseat, was conceived due to the National Day of Education Professionals. :books:
